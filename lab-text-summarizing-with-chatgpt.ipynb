    "A clear goal and an iterative approach prove to be essintial for reliable results.With this approach, the results improved in each version. I combined the clarity of Version 2 with the value focus of Version 3, which delivered a meaningful result. Through reflection on the results and through iterative refinemenet Version 4 came into being combining the advantages of the previous versions in order to produce short, consice but still meaningful and informative customer review summaries."
